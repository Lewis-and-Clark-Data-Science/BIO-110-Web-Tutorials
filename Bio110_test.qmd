## Introduction

Welcome to **Part 2 of the Air Quality Data Science Tutorials**! If you have not done Part 1 yet, [click here](AQI_tutorial.qmd) to complete that tutorial first - it will provide helpful background info about air quality and the basics of data science.

Part 2 will build off of the graphs created in Part 1 and allow you to customize them with your own locations as well as create different types of graphs.
