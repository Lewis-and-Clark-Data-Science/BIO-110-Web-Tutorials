In Biology courses, most of the time your data will be in the form of a table with columns and rows.\nLater on, you will learn how to import your own data table into R in order to work with it. For now, we will work with a very simple set of data: data for a single variable."

    "text": "Working with data\nFor example, suppose you have measured the diameters of a sample of 8 bacterial colonies. The data values (in mm) are: 4, 3.5, 6.1, 2.2, 4.7, 3, 5.2, and 4.6.\n\nAssigning values to a variable name\nIn R, you ‘assign’ these values to a variable name using an ‘arrow’ formed by the ‘less than’ symbol and the dash, like this: &lt;-.\nOn the left side of the arrow, put the name of the variable you wish to create. The name should be short, descriptive, and must not contain any spaces. On the right of the arrow, type your data values, separated by commas. The data values should be enclosed in parentheses, and preceded by the letter c, which stands for ‘concatenate’ or ‘combine’ all the values into a single vector of values.\nThis command creates a variable called ‘diam’ that contains our example data values: diam&lt;-c(4,3.5,6.1,2.2,4.7,3,5.2,4.6)\nNow you should try creating the diam variable using these same data. In the code chunk below, type in a command to create diam.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nDon’t forget the parentheses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndiam&lt;- c(4,3.5,6.1,2.2,4.7,3,5.2,4.6)\n\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in knowing what a variable contains, you can just type its name. R is case-sensitive, so be careful about whether you type in upper or lower case.\nTry typing diam and see what you get.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nJust type the word diam.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing data tables\nIn an R data table, each column represents a different variable. Each observational unit is represented by a separate row in the table. The first row of the table is used for the names of the different variables. In R, variable names must not contain any spaces.\nA table with this format has been created for you and imported into this tutorial. It has been given the creative name of data.\nType a command that will show you a display of the data table called “data”.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nTo see an object in R, type its name. No quotes are required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndata\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that this data table contains 4 variables and 15 rows. (Also, each row is numbered sequentially; these numbers are not considered a variable.)\nThese data are from a physiological study. Each individual’s respiratory quotient (RQ) was measured, either after exercise (1), or during rest (2). Their heart rates in beats per minute were also measured. NA stands for ‘not available,’ meaning that the data for these combinations of individual and variable were lost or not recorded.\n\nSpecifying Variables\nYou might wish to see just one of the variables in this data file. The way to specify an individual variable is to use the name of the data file, followed by the dollar sign, $, followed by the name of the variable – with no spaces.\nWhat would you type to see a list of the heart_rate data values in this file?\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndata$heart_rate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Structure\nIn R, each variable is encoded as either numeric (a number), integer (a whole number), a factor (a category, expressed either as a word or a number), or character (a string of letters). There are other less common variable properties as well. A variable’s property is important because some operations can only be carried out on variables with certain properties.\nA data file’s ‘structure’ refers to the properties of its variables. To find out the properties of all the variables in a data set, you would use the command str(dataname), using the name of your data file in place of the placeholder here.\nWrite a command that will allow you to see the structure of ‘data.’\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstr(data)\n\n\n\n\n\nChanging a variable’s property\nYou can see that the variable data$Condition is currently encoded as an integer. But it is actually a category variable. You can change this variable’s property with the assignment arrow, in the following way: data$Condition &lt;-as.factor(data$Condition).\nTry changing the variable named Individual to a factor variable. You will notice that a little prompt box shows up. You can save yourself some typing by choosing the rest of the expression from among the choices in the prompt box.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember to use the dollar sign notation, and that R is case-sensitive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndata$Individual&lt;-as.factor(data$Individual)\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations! You have finished the first R tutorial. You have learned how to create a variable in R, how data files in R are organized, and how to examine and change the properties of different variables."

    "text": "Introduction\nWelcome. In this lesson, you will learn about central tendency.\n\nAnalyzing Central Tendency\nWhen analyzing a set of data values, it is often important to summarize where the numerical ‘center’ of the data values lies.”\nStart by creating a variable called “mydata” that contains the values 4, 4, 2, 6, 3, 0, and 3\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you remember to use the assignment arrow and the concatenate operator? Did you copy the values correctly?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmydata&lt;-c(4, 4, 2, 6, 3, 0, 3)\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculating Mean and Median\nThe mean (also known as the average) is a commonly-used measure of the center of a set of values. To compute the mean, you can use the command mean(dataname), substituting the name of your variable for the placeholder shown here.\nTry it now with your mydata variable.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nPut the name of your variable in the parentheses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmean(mydata)\n\n\n\n\nFor some data sets, the mean is not a very good measure of the data’s central tendency. For example, what if your data values were 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 12?\nTo analyze this data, create a new variable, data_two, containing these values.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nDon’t forget to use the assignment arrow and the concatenate function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndata_two&lt;-c(2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 12)\n\n\n\n\nNext, compute the mean of data_two.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nPut the mean of your variable in parentheses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmean(data_two)\n\n\n\n\nNotice that all but one of the data values are lower than the mean, because there is one really high value. For data like these, the median is a better measure of central tendency. The median is the middle value when the data are ordered from lowest to highest.\nThe function median() computes the median for a variable.\nCompute the median of data_two.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmedian(data_two)\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the median is not unduly influenced by the single large data value, and so is a more accurate measure of the center of the data values.\nNext, write an expression for the difference between the mean and the median of data_two. R uses the symbols + for addition, - for subtraction, * for multiplication, and / for division. Subtract the smaller value from the larger value.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nSeparate these two quantities with a minus sign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmean(data_two)-median(data_two)\n\n\n\n\nYou may be wondering how to know whether to use the mean or the median. This can be especially challenging if you have a variable with many data values.\n\n\nHistograms\nYou can examine the distribution of the data values visually using a histogram. A histogram shows how many data values fall into different size categories.\nThe function hist() creates a histogram for a variable.\nCreate a histogram for the original data variable, called mydata.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhist(mydata)\n\n\n\n\nYou should see a histogram pop up under the code block. On the x-axis are intervals (bins) representing the different possible data values. On the y-axis are the frequencies with which different data values are present in the data set (once, twice, etc.).\nNow create a second histogram for data_two.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can see from the histogram that the mean of data_two does not describe these data very well. When a histogram’s peak is not near the center, and/or its two tails are quite asymetrical, it’s best to use the median, not the mean, to summarize the central tendency.\nThat’s the end of this lesson on central tendency. Another important kind of descriptive statistic is variability; that’s the topic of lesson three."

    "text": "Variation Around a Central Tendency\nYou have already learned that one important way to summarize a set of data values is with a measure of central tendency, the mean or the median.\nAnother important summary statistic is the amount of variation around that central tendency.\n\nDataset\nThis lesson contains a dataset that you will work with, named data.

The variance is the square of the average difference between each data value and the mean.\nYou can compute the variance of a variable with the var() function.\nUse var() to compute the variance of the RQ for the two conditions.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the tapply() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntapply(data$RQ,data$Condition,var)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck your work\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the variance of the Condition column?\n\n\n\n\n ✗1.80123\n\n\n ✓0.001757\n\n\n ✗0.001995\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother common measure of variance is the standard deviation, which is simply the square root of the variance. The function for standard deviation is sd().\nCompute the standard deviation of RQ for each of the two conditions.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you remember that R is case-sensitive?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntapply(data$RQ,data$Condition,sd)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck your work\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the standard deviation of the Condition column?\n\n\n\n\n ✓0.0419\n\n\n ✗0.0447\n\n\n ✗0.0223\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard error and confidence intervals\nOne reason to compute the variability in a data set is to get an idea of how accurately our sample has estimated the mean of a population. Two additional measures of variability, standard error and confidence intervals, do this more usefully than variance or standard deviation.\nThis is because both standard error and confidence intervals become smaller as the sample size, or number of data values, gets larger – which reflects our increased certainty that our sample mean represents the true population mean.\nTo compute the standard error of a set of data in R, a package called plotrix is required. In this tutorial, plotrix has already been installed for you.\nThe function for computing the standard error is std.error().\nCompute the standard error of RQ for each of the two conditions.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the same syntax as you did for computing standard deviation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntapply(data$RQ,data$Condition,std.error)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck your work\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the standard error of the RQ column?\n\n\n\n\n ✓0.0169\n\n\n ✗0.1238\n\n\n ✗0.0447\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfidence Intervals\nConfidence intervals are closely related to standard error. The 95% confidence interval is a range of data values that encloses the sample mean. There is a 95% probability that the “true” mean lies within the 95% confidence interval of the sample mean.\nThe easiest way to compute a 95% confidence interval is to use the t.test() function.\nThe command for the t-test is t.test(dataname$variablename), using the actual datafile and variable names instead of the placeholders shown here.\nLet’s compute the confidence interval of the variable RQ measured during exercise. To do this, we need a way to extract a subset of the RQ data – just the RQ values measured under Condition 1.\nIn R, we do this by ‘indexing’ the value of one variable (RQ) by the value of a second variable (Condition). In this case, we wish to extract the values of RQ for those observations (rows) where Condition is exactly equal to 1(==1, in r-speak). The syntax is: data$RQ[data$Condition==1].\nNow write the command to perform a t-test on the subset of RQ values measured under Condition 1, exercise.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nt.test(data$RQ[data$Condition==1])\n\n\n\n\nIn the output, you should see the name of the variable you created, followed by two lines of information that are not relevant if you are only interested in knowing the 95% confidence interval. The 95% confidence interval is on the following line, followed by a computation of the sample mean.\nSo for these data, the (rounded) sample mean is 0.876, and the 95% confidence interval ranges from a minimum value of 0.834 to a maximum of 0.917.\n\n\nCongratulations!\nYou’ve completed lesson three, in which you learned how to compute several measures of variability (variance, standard deviation, standard error, and confidence intervals). You also learned two ways to subset a data set: using tapply() and indexing. In lesson four you will learn how to make a box plot, which is a basic way of graphically displaying the central tendency and the variability of any data set."
